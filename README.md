#Sentiment Analysis
Overview

This project is focused on analyzing the sentiment of text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or feedback. The goal is to classify a given piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis plays an important role in understanding user opinions, improving customer experiences, and supporting business decisions.

Features

Preprocesses and cleans raw text data

Extracts features using natural language processing techniques

Trains machine learning or deep learning models for sentiment classification

Provides predictions for new input text

Evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

Tech Stack

Python as the programming language

Pandas and NumPy for data handling

Scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation

NLTK or spaCy for text preprocessing

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

TensorFlow or PyTorch if deep learning models are used

Project Structure

The project contains the following components:

Data folder with raw and processed datasets

Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experiments

Source code for preprocessing, model training, and prediction

Models folder for saving trained models

Requirements file listing project dependencies

Readme file for project documentation

Installation and Setup

To set up the project, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the required dependencies listed in the requirements file. The dataset can either be included or downloaded from a source such as IMDB reviews, Twitter sentiment data, or Amazon product reviews.

Usage

The workflow of the project includes three main steps. First, train the model using the prepared dataset. Second, evaluate the model to check accuracy and other performance measures. Finally, use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new text inputs.

Results

The model performance is measured using standard evaluation metrics. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are reported. Confusion matrices and visualizations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in classifying sentiments correctly.

Deployment

The sentiment analysis model can be deployed as a web application for real-world use. Options include creating a backend using Flask or FastAPI, or building an interactive user interface with Streamlit or Gradio. The application can be containerized with Docker and hosted on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
